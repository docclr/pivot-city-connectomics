**Integrating AI into Entrepreneurial Ecosystems Aligned with Pivot.City Connectomics Framework
Five-Year Snapshot (2021-2025)**

**Overview**

JAX Bridges, the entrepreneurship program of the JAX Chamber of Commerce in Jacksonville, FL, embarked in 2022 on a strategic integration of artificial intelligence into its service model under the leadership of Carlton Lamar Robinson, DBA. By 2025 the program achieved measurable operational gains, providing a live regional example of the Connectomics architecture in practice.

**Key Milestones**

2022: AI capability developed; pilot testing began.

2023: AI enrolled into program workflows (custom subset of ChatGPT deployed).

2024–25: Full deployment across twice-yearly cohorts; publicly recognized as national exemplar. (See Business Journal & Daily Record coverage)

2025: Achievement: reducing business-plan prep time from ~75 hours to 4 hours. For the first time, mentors were onboarded in weeks instead of a year.

**Connectomics Stack Applied**

**Sense:** Pre-class AI intake call captures signals from entrepreneurs and firms.

**Compute:** Custom AI module analyses firm data, generates individualized business/marketing plans; mentors and staff interpret outputs.

**Strategic Significance**

This case illustrates how a mid-sized U.S. city can operationalize the Connectomics architecture: converting entrepreneurial ecosystem support into a layered cognitive system. The result: higher leverage, faster insight, improved access. For regional economic development, the model signals a shift from “pipeline support” to “cognitive network enablement”.

**Lessons & Implications**

Human-AI hybrid models scale entrepreneur support without sacrificing human judgement.

Capturing state (context) before advising improves quality and meeting efficiency.

AI modules tailored to domain knowledge (entrepreneurial support) deliver meaningful impact.

Ecosystem actors (chambers, accelerators) can become cognitive-network hubs—not just service providers.

Validates the importance of trust protocols and governance (human oversight, peer-mentor role preserved).
